   <h2>What happened</h2>
   <p> Can I steal my neighbor's car and then give it to you and tell you it's yours? Of course not, I don't own it, and I have no right to dispose of it. They did that. They gave the land of Palestine to groups of outcasts under the slogan “A land without a people for a people without a land” in 1917 in what was called the Balfour Declaration.</p>
   <p>These outcast groups, loaded with weapons, coveted the entire land, so they began to commit massacres one after another, emptying some villages and areas of their indigenous inhabitants, and terrorizing the neighboring residents and pushing them to abandon their lands and flee for their lives.</p>
   <p>After that came the Nakba and its horrors and what it did to the Palestinians in 1948 When they said, “Go out temporarily and you will come back later.” , followed by the Nakba in 1967.All this while we were talking about the most prominent stages in the Palestinian tragedy, and we did not mention the displacement and massacres that befell them even in refugee camps, even after they forcibly left their homes and lands. We did not mention someone who lived in a house, between loving parents and brothers, and owned lands, fields, and money, and suddenly became a refugee with no money or a home. Perhaps he is lucky because he still has two parents, or at least one of them, and part of his brothers, to share with him the refugee tent and its bitterness.</p>
   <p>If you were born in Gaza shortly before 2007, you'll know what I'm talking about. You will remember when the Kinder Egg candy, with its brightly colored wrapper and distinctive taste, which carried a toy inside, began to disappear from the markets. Yes, that is the period in which life imprisonment for everyone inside the Gaza Strip began.Since then, Gaza has been suffering from woes. The matter is not limited to poor living conditions, asylum, and high population density inside the largest prison in the world, but there are also wars. Yes, that brutal occupation not only isolated them from the world, but also waged hideous wars against them.</p>
